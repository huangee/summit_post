       "    'comment': 'i made it to lone tree pass just as the clouds wind and rain rolled in i passed some jerk kids who left a trail of filth and garbage in their wake which i picked up on the way backonce i neared the north summit the wind picked up and really started to chill me down as i had packed light i had no rain shell so i postponed my hike and made a shelter in a large ice cornice near the north summit after a cold wet night i packed up my gear and quickly got lost on the glacier crossing back to the south summit visibility had dropped to  i wandered around for about  the only way to tell the direction i was heading was by the wind direction eventually i came across some cairns and found the route back down to the lone tree pass approachit was a miserable trip but still worth it',\n",
